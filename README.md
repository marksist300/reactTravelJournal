# Travel Journal Project
A travel journal designed with figma and made with React.
This project is a fully responsive travel journal page. It was made to get more time using React, playing with components and props and mapping over data sets.

## How It's Made:
The design was made in figma and actual site built using React
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React JS


## Optimizations
This page could be one of many on a personal site or blog post, so as an optimisation it could be extended to include other pages etc. Also a light mode could be added to reverse the colour scheme with a little JS

## Lessons Learned:
The whole idea of the project was to spend more time working with React, thinking of and organising a simple project in terms of components, props etc. The page was quick to build and I reiterated over things I've used before so it was a great exercise in spaced repetition too. This definitely helped improve my confidence in React as I continue on to learn more
